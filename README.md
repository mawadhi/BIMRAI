# Building Information Modeling and Rendering for Artificial Intelligence (BIMrAI)
Teaching AI machines to detect building objects is at the foundation toward achieving AI-assisted 3D recostruction of builidings. However, there exists the challenge of acquiring enough training data for deep learning that is typically manually-annotated. 

This project trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) solely on computer generated images of 3D paremetric buildings modelsâ€”which were automatically-generated using the Building Information Modeling Generation Environment (BIMGenE) program developed in Grasshopper. The AI training result demonstrated accurate semantic segmenation on arbitrary photos of buildings.

This repository documents the ANN training implementation of this project.
